### Author
Hi, I'm Grzegorz SÅ‚awecki. I live in Poland, in the town of [Wieliczka], which is world-famous for it's old salt mine. 
I'm a professional programmer, currently creating in .NET related technologies, However I try not to be ignorant of other software ecosystems. 
I'm also a huge fan of functional programming, and a firm believer in great engineering.

### Blog
The idea for this blog is to be a documentation for my personal discoveries about writing good software. 
I also hope the articles published here will bring value to anyone reading them, and to me as well.
You might expect lots of F# code, but also some thought on software design in general. For future I plan not to limit to F# only.
