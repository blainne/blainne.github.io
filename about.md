### Author
Hi, my name is Grzegorz SÅ‚awecki. I live in Poland, in the town of [Wieliczka], which is world-famous for it's old salt mine. 
I'm a professional programmer, currently creating in .NET related technologies, although I do my best not to be ignorant of other software ecosystems. 
I'm also a huge fan of functional programming, and a firm believer in great engineering.

### Blog
The idea for this blog is to be a documentation for my personal discoveries about writing software. 
I also hope the articles published here will bring value to anyone reading them, and to me as well.
You might expect lots of C# and F# code, but also some thought on software design in general. Since I'm passionate about learning different programming languages and models, this blog will not be limited to those two mentioned only.
